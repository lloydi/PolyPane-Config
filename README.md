This is a set of config files (PolyPane workspaces - .ppws extension) that are geared towards testing for accessibility issues. It is not an exhaustive collection, just a subset of views that I have personally found very handy to have available for side-by-side visual comparison.

Included here are:

* Full Set - A good cross-section of view that includes light mode and dark mode comparisons, forced colors (AKA 'High Contrast'), SC 1.4.4 Resize Text and SC 1.4.10 Reflow views and CSS disabled.
* Light, dark & High Contrast Modes - Just these three modes for easier comparison of color and contrast issues.
* Resize and Reflow Checks - Just two panes to assess text resize and reflow issues.
* Text Spacing - 4 panes set for mobile, tablet, laptop and large desktop with text spacing settings applied (to test SC 1.4.12 Text Spacing).
